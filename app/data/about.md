#### Intro

I am an innovative, solutions-based thinker with technical experience across the application development stack, from wireframing and UI to datastore. On the front end I work with CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, Sass/scss, and Bootstrap with vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, and React/Redux. On the back end I work in Node and Express, with MondgoDB and SQL databases. I'm fluent with RESTful endpoints and have a dedicated interest in GraphQL with Apollo, which I've been studying and implementing. I'm drawn to full-stack work and the craft of communication at its center, connecting the front and back ends.
<br><br>
My completed college coursework includes a degree in communication studies with a specialty in media production, and also quantitative studies: the near-equivalent of minors in chemistry and mathematics. A veteran of the publishing industry, I have more than a decade of expertise in written and verbal communication, with high acumen for personal connection, ingenuity, and stick-to-it-ness in the workplace. I'm a believer in Agile methodologies and revel in complex challenges independently or as part of a team. I also enjoy working with API documentation, user documentation, and endeavors to clarify tech and increase accessibility to fellow techies and laypersons alike.
<br><br>
An eager learner, I follow new developments in tech through a variety of outlets and experiment with them hands-on when I'm so compelled. Some of my past projects are deployed at GitHub Pages and on Heroku. My current projects include a MERN-stack social site for writers and a HackerNews clone built with Node, Prisma, GraphQL, and React.

#### My Journey: Editor to Software Engineer

I am a language and communication enthusiast. This has led me to work on publication efforts for the United Nations in Kenya, to develop and teach a college-level English curriculum at a university in Thailand, and to serve as a longtime editor for the independent literary magazine [_The Sun_](https://thesunmagazine.org).
<br><br>
During my time at [_The Sun_](https://thesunmagazine.org), I specialized in long-form interviews with experts and thought leaders in a variety of fields including [technology](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/353/voodoo-electronics), [psychology](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/401/the-science-of-happiness), [spirituality](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/512/our-grand-delusion), [social activism](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/513/prisoner-of-hope), and [environmental conservation](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/497/a-walk-on-the-wild-side).
<br><br>
Throughout my career in the publishing industry, I was attentive to the many new platforms introduced and improved by the evolution of web technology and software development. I was enamored by the semantic qualities of programming languages. I was enthralled with the ways software empowers creative expression and extends interpersonal connection. With the help of online courses and tutorials, the generous assistance of friends in the field, and extensive reading and practice, I stayed abreast of the tech and furthered my understanding and my coding skills.
<br>
<br>
In February 2019 I enrolled in a full-time software engineering fellowship at [Project Shift](https://projectshift.io) in Durham, North Carolina, to augment my skills in full-stack JavaScript, computer science principles, and industry best practices. Working independently, via pair-programming, and as part of an eleven-member team, I completed more than twenty projects, culminating in my capstone: a platform for authors to collaborate on open-source writing projects, modeled after the GitHub paradigm.
<br>
<br>
I decided to build my capstone with [GraphQL](https://youtu.be/783ccP__No8), a technology not included in the [Project Shift](https://projectshift.io) curriculum. I thought that teaching myself its ins and outs would add a fresh dimension to the MERN-stack app I was developing. Midway through I had a realization: Of course I, the literary editor, would be drawn to [GraphQL](https://youtu.be/783ccP__No8), an innovative query language and runtime that facilitates communication between the front end and back end. That does so with an emphasis on specificity, clarity, and efficiency. That, you might even say, does so with an artistic elegance.  
<br>
After graduating from the fellowship, I resumed my self-directed study of software engineering, developing increasingly advanced projects. I prefer to build with [GraphQL](https://youtu.be/783ccP__No8) these days, although I've also been investigating its drawbacks and scenarios where it's not the best option, so I continue to implement REST, too.
<br>
<br>
I bring my instincts as an editor and writer to my work as an engineer. I have a keen eye for small details, errors, efficiency, and design. I relish collaboration with others. And I do the best I can to maintain an open and curious mind. At my most open, I sometimes see reflections of humanity in the code, quiet connections between the human-made world of software, and how our experiences make _us_.
<br>
<br>
For instance: How we protect and preserve state, but how we must also find ways to update it, how functionality depends on that. How outward-facing appearances consist of a complexity of components, all visual renderings of a deeper, less visible logic. How we strive to fix the bugs, and, when we don't have the time or wherewithal to fix them, how we hide them or neutralize them or just live with them in plain sight.
<br>
<br>
How hard it is to name things, how we have such a variety of naming conventions, how they fail us. But still we forge ahead. Sometimes with spectacular flair. How we must leave some parts out, how improvement is always within reach. How we may never, ever, in a gazillion years, create a stable maximum viable product. How, despite or because of this, we are more alive when we try.
