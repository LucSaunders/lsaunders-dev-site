#### Intro

<br>
Iâ€™m an analytical thinker with technical experience across the application development stack. Much of my recent work leverages Twilio Flex to build omnichannel contact centers with React-driven plugins and serverless microservices in Node. My current interests include cloud computing, natural language processing, and metrics-building for analytics reporting.

A veteran of the publishing industry, I love the unexpected ways my editorial instincts surface during software development. I enjoy working with API documentation, user documentation, and other endeavors to clarify tech and increase accessibility to fellow techies and laypersons alike. I value personal connection in the workplace, and the moments of thoughtful communication -- big and small, in-person or virtual -- that support personal relationships and the notion that we're all building something meaningful together.
