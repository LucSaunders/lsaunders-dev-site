I am a language and communication enthusiast. This has led me to work on publication efforts for the United Nations in Kenya, to develop and teach a college-level English curriculum at a university in Thailand, and to serve as a longtime editor for the independent literary magazine [_The Sun_](https://thesunmagazine.org).
<br>
<br>
During my time at [_The Sun_](https://thesunmagazine.org), I collaborated with some of the most talented, reflective, and revealing writers working today. I specialized in long-form intervcd iews with experts and thought leaders in a variety of fields including [technology](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/353/voodoo-electronics), [psychology](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/496/an-open-mind), [spirituality](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/512/our-grand-delusion), [social activism](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/513/prisoner-of-hope), and [environmental conservation](https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/497/a-walk-on-the-wild-side).

Throughout my career in the publishing industry, I was attentive to the many new platforms introduced and improved by the evolution of web technology and software development. I was enamored by the semantic qualities of programming languages. I was enthralled with the ways software empowers creative expression and extends interpersonal connection. With the help of online courses and tutorials and extensive reading and practice, I stayed abreast of the tech and furthered my understanding and my coding skills.
<br>
<br>
In February 2019 I enrolled in a software engineering fellowship at the [Project Shift](https://projectshift.io) code school in Durham, North Carolina, where I worked in full-stack JavaScript. Working independently, via pair-programming, and in an eleven-member team, I completed more than twenty projects, culminating in my capstone: a platform for authors to advertise and collaborate on open-source writing projects.
<br>
<br>
I decided to build my capstone with [GraphQL](https://youtu.be/urmi2wbEpGk), a technology that wasn't part of the [Project Shift](https://projectshift.io) curriculum. I thought that teaching myself its ins and outs would add a fresh dimension to the MERN-stack app I was developing. Midway through I had a eureka moment: Of course I, the literary editor, would be drawn to [GraphQL](https://youtu.be/urmi2wbEpGk), an innovative query language and runtime that facilitates communication between the front end and back end. That asks and answers questions. That does so with an emphasis on specificity, clarity, and efficiency. That, you might even say, does so with an artistic elegance.  
<br>
After graduating from the fellowship, I resumed my self-directed study of software engineering, plying away on increasingly advanced projects. I mostly build with [GraphQL](https://youtu.be/urmi2wbEpGk) these days, although I've also been investigating its drawbacks and scenarios where it's not the best option. Some of my cohortmates excel primarily in the front-end or back-end. I like the full stack, and the art and craft of communication at its center.
<br>
<br>
I bring my instincts as an editor and writer to my work as an engineer. I do the best I can to maintain an open and curious mind. At my most open, I sometimes see reflections of humanity in the code. Digital anthropology, this field of study is called. I think of it as a persistent, active observer at the periphery, silently mapping connections between the human-made world of software, and how our experiences make _us_.
<br>
<br>
For instance: How we protect and preserve state, but how we must also find ways to update it, and how functionality depends on that. How our creative endeavors are guided by the dictates of a minimum viable product, but how we simultaneously dream of what could be and plan for features to be added in the future. How our outward-facing appearance consists of a complexity of components, all visual renderings of a deeper, less visible logic at our core. How we strive to fix the bugs, and, when we donâ€™t have the time or wherewithal to fix them, how we hide them or neutralize them or just live with them out in plain sight. How, no matter the accuracy of interpretation, it takes a miraculous, mindboggling assembly of bits and pieces and packages and environments and dependencies for an act of communication to even be possible.
<br>
<br>
How hard it is to name things, how we have such a variety of naming conventions, how they fail us. But still we try. Sometimes with spectacular flair. How challenging it can be to tell a cohesive story, how we must leave some parts out, how language comes up short, how improvement is always within reach, how change seems to be the elemental particle that comprises everything we know and do. How we may never, ever, in a gazillion years, create a stable maximum viable product. How, despite or because of this, we are so very alive when we try.
